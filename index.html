        <h1>Gabriel Kurea's Previous Coding Projects (2019-2020)</h1>
        <p>This is Gabriel Kurea. One of Dr. Cheng's coding students. I had fun with his coding class! I get to make websites and show how interactive the websites are! It was a great experience, and I get feedback for my work, too! I can show you all the websites I had made over the school year! As for you Dr. Cheng, from what I've heard, you won't be returning to being a teacher this Fall which is a shame, considering that I, including the rest of your students, will miss you. You are an awesome coding teacher and you had the potential to provide feedback and assistance over the school year. It was fun having to code a site especially with you! Thank you for how our coding class turns out, it was amazing! This also goes for people at Code Nation who helped me and the rest of the students in our coding class, you guys rock, too!</p>
        
        <p>Here are the coding websites I had put work on in the entire 2019-2020 school year. I had no regrets on any of them! :D</p>
